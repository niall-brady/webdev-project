# Webdev Project
Group repository for a mock webdev project

## Goals for the Project
**Connecting to the gateway process of a kdb+ TorQ stack, create a
GUI/dashboard that includes the following:**

1. Current price for each instrument, with the ability to display up
to 3 days history (filter option for 1/2/3 days, etc)

2. Max & min prices from (1) in summary boxes
)

3. A time series graph showing the running average price for each
instrument for the day as a line graph, with a sliding time filter

4. Last value cache for each instrument as a dynamic table, with colour
change on table cell for price change (e.g. price goes down –> red,
up –> green)

5. Summary box detailing the highest traded instrument over a date/time
range

6. Volatility graph for each instrument (with options for date range
history and filters on instrument)
